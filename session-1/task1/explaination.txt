This output shows that you are using Python 3.12 or newer, as it includes recent optimizations to the CPython interpreter.

Each line represents an operation on the virtual stack: 

RESUME: A no-op instruction used for internal bookkeeping. It marks the start of a function or a 
point where execution resumes (like after a yield).

LOAD_GLOBAL (NULL + print): Searches for the print function in the global namespace. 
The NULL + part is an optimization that pushes a NULL value onto the stack before the function, 
which helps Python distinguish between regular function calls and method calls.

LOAD_CONST ('Hello'): Pushes the literal string 'Hello' onto the top of the stack.

CALL 1: Pops the argument ('Hello') and the function (print) from the stack, executes the call, 
and pushes the result back up. The 1 indicates there is one positional argument.

POP_TOP: Since you didn't assign the result of print() to a variable, this instruction
removes the returned value (None) from the stack.

RETURN_CONST (None): A specialized instruction added in Python 3.12 that combines 
loading the constant None and returning it in a single step.
